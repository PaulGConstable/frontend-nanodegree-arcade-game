frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This is my Frogger clone for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree

To Play:

- Download the repository:
- Click 'download ZIP' on the right of the screen, then extract the zip file to your computer, or clone the repository using git.
- Navigate to where you unzipped the file or cloned the repository.
- Double-click index.html to open the game in your browser.

Gameplay:

- Use the arrow keys to move.
- The objective is to reach the top of the water to score a point.
- Each time you reach the top of the water your player will reset to start position.
- Avoid the bugs, otherwise lose a life. You start with three lives.
